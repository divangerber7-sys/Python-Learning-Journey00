# Lesson 01 - Variables and Basic Data Types

In this lesson, I learned about **variables** in Python and how they act as containers for values.  
I explored the four common data types:  

- **Strings** → Text values (e.g., names, email addresses, favorite food)  
- **Integers** → Whole numbers (e.g., age, quantity)  
- **Floats** → Numbers with decimals (e.g., price, GPA, distance)  
- **Booleans** → True/False values  

I also practiced:  
- Using **f-strings** for cleaner formatting  
- A simple **if/else statement** to check conditions
