# 🔄 Python Multithreading Demo

This project demonstrates the difference between running tasks **sequentially** vs **concurrently** using Python's `threading` module.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Shows how tasks run one after another (sequential execution).
- Shows how tasks can run concurrently using `threading.Thread`.
- Demonstrates how to pass arguments to a thread using `args`.

---

## 📦 Requirements
No external libraries needed — just Python 3.

---

## ▶️ Usage
Run the script:

```bash
python multithreading_demo.py


Example:

Running chores sequentially...
Walking Dog
You take out the trash
Getting Mail
All chores are complete (sequential).

Running chores with multithreading...
You take out the trash
Getting Mail
You have finished walking Flynn Siff
All chores are complete (multithreading).
