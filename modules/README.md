## Lesson 39 â€“ Modules ðŸ“¦
ðŸ“Œ *Concepts learned:*  
- A **module** is just a Python file you can import into another.  
- Use `import math` to access built-in math constants/functions.  
- Use `import module_name as alias` for convenience.  
- Avoid `from module import *` â€“ it can cause naming conflicts.  
- Create your own module (`example.py`) and import it into your main file.
