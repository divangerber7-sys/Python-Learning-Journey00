## Lesson 40 – Variable Scope & LEGB 🔍
📌 *Concepts learned:*  
- **Local**: Variables inside a function (only visible there).  
- **Enclosed**: Variables in outer functions (visible to inner functions).  
- **Global**: Variables defined at the top-level of the script.  
- **Built-in**: Python’s reserved names (e.g., `len`, `math.e`).  
- Python resolves names in order: **Local → Enclosed → Global → Built-in**.
