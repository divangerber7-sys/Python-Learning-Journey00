## Lesson 30 – Substitution Cipher 🔑
📌 *Concepts learned:*  
- Using `string` to work with letters, digits, and punctuation.  
- Generating randomized substitution keys with `random.shuffle()`.  
- Encrypting and decrypting by mapping characters between lists.  
- Understanding basic cryptography principles.  

⚠️ Note: This is **not secure cryptography** (easily breakable). It’s just for learning how substitution ciphers work.
